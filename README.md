# Asteroid-Analysis-Dashboard
Developed a web-based dashboard that visualizes real-time asteroid data from NASAâ€™s Near-Earth Object Web Service API. Built with Python, Pandas, and Streamlit, the app allows users to explore, filter, and analyze asteroids by date, size, distance, and velocity, providing interactive graphs and summary statistics for planetary defense awareness.
